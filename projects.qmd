I am interested in a wide variety of statistical topics, but recently I have taken a particular liking to the Bayesian paradigm. Here are a brief list of some projects I have worked on recently. For more projects, please see my [GitHub](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1).

[**Sleeper Bayesian**](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/SleeperBayesian) **(2024)**

-   With fellow PhD student, Daniel Illera, we model NBA player fantasy performance with a Bayesian normal hierarchical model. We then apply Game Theory principals to develop decision boundaries for fantasy users to optimize their performance.

**Skinner, C.; Li, Meng (2025), "Exact Partial Constancy Prior for Structured Ensemble Forecasting"** - *working paper*

-   Proposes a widely applicable exact partial constancy prior for a principled Bayesian approach to forecast aggregation and ensemble learning. Paper features specific applications to expert forecasts of unemployment rate and treasury bill rate in the United States.

**Skinner, C.; Sturdivant, R. (2024), “Is Momentum Real: On the Existence and Influences of Psychological Momentum in Tennis"**

-   Undergraduate Thesis measuring and analyzing psychological momentum under the direction of Dr. Rodney Sturdivant. Defining momentum as the backward approximation of the derivative of the players’ smoothed point margin curve, we find that a player’s momentum entering a point has a significant impact on his or her likelihood of winning the next point. You can find the full document [here](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/TennisMomentum).

[**SCORE Network**](https://scorenetwork.org) **Material Developer (Summer 2023)**

-   Skinner, C, Patrick, J, Bryson, C. & Sturdivant, R. (2025, June 16). Mixed Martial Arts - Interrater Reliability. "The SCORE Network." [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/F8VBQ](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/F8VBQ)
-   Researched and compiled formulas, explanations, and examples fit for teaching [cluster analysis](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/NBACluster), [inter-rater reliability](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/MMAKappa), and [logistic regression](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/TennisLogistic). Developed three 20-50-page interactive lesson plans using extensive data from three sports.

**Sports Analytics Club – Vice President (2021-2023)**

-   Collaborated with Statistics PhD student Ryan Hebdon to develop a website (with R’s ShinyApp) filled with numerous interactive visualizations and tables utilized by Baylor baseball’s staff.

[**Global Health Survey**](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/GlobalHealthSurvey) **(2021-2022)**

-   Produced \~50 pages of visualizations and statistical analysis for a research paper assessing the opinions of Global Health among undergraduate students.

**Football Analytics Blitz (2022)**

-   Analyzed NFL data from 2021 to create a comprehensive game-strategy in Syracuse University’s case competition. Produced visualizations justifying decisions and presented conclusions to a panel of judges.
