I am interested in a wide variety of statistical topics, but recently I have taken a particular liking to the Bayesian paradigm. Here are a brief list of some projects I have worked on recently. For more projects, please see my [GitHub](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1).

**[Sleeper Bayesian**](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/SleeperBayesian) **(2024)**
-   With fellow PhD student, Daniel Illera, we model NBA player fantasy performance with a Bayesian normal hierarchical model. We then apply Game Theory principals to develop decision boundaries for fantasy users to optimize their performance.

**Ensemble Forecasting** - *In progress*
-   Working with Dr. Meng Li, this project applies two novel ensemble forecasting methods, partially-egalitarian lasso (Diebold & Shin, 2019) and double-spiked dirichlet priors (Lin & Li, 2022), to expert forecasts of the quarterly unemployment rate and quarterly treasury bill rate. Both methods aim to shrink the forecaster pool and optimize the weight of the forecasters. Initial results show that the double-spiked dirichlet priors method provides preferable results.

**Skinner, C.; Sturdivant, R. (2024), “Is Momentum Real: On the Existence and Influences of Psychological Momentum in Tennis"**

-   Undergraduate Thesis measuring and analyzing psychological momentum under the direction of Dr. Rodney Sturdivant. You can find the final document [here](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/TennisMomentum).

[**SCORE Network**](https://scorenetwork.org) **Material Developer (Summer 2023)**

-   Researched and compiled formulas, explanations, and examples fit for teaching [cluster analysis](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/NBACluster), [inter-rater reliability](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/MMAKappa), and [logistic regression](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/TennisLogistic). Developed three 20-50-page interactive lesson plans using extensive data from three sports.

**Sports Analytics Club – Vice President (2021-2023)**

-   Collaborated with Statistics PhD student Ryan Hebdon to develop a website (with R’s ShinyApp) filled with numerous interactive visualizations and tables utilized by Baylor baseball’s staff.

[**Global Health Survey**](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1/GlobalHealthSurvey) **(2021-2022)**

-   Produced \~50 pages of visualizations and statistical analysis for a research paper assessing the opinions of Global Health among undergraduate students.

**Football Analytics Blitz (2022)**

-   Analyzed NFL data from 2021 to create a comprehensive game-strategy in Syracuse University’s case competition. Produced visualizations justifying decisions and presented conclusions to a panel of judges.
