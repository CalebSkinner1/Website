Hello! I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. I moved to Houston after graduating with my Bachelor's degree from Baylor University in the Spring 2024.

I've always been a curious person, and statistics is a powerful instrument for uncovering relationships and exploring the unanswered questions of this world. My time at Rice has deepended these curiosities, while giving me a strong theoretical foundation.

Working with my advisor, [Dr. Meng Li](https://meng.rice.edu), my current research focuses on Bayesian variable/model selection, with applications in finance and biostatistics.

If I'm not modeling or dreaming of statistics, I like to cook with my wife, Sarah, or play a board game with some friends. I love playing [tennis](https://calebskinner1.github.io/Tennis-GOAT/), watching (football)[https://calebskinner.shinyapps.io/fantasy-dashboard/], and on Sunday morning, you'll find me at my church, Sojourn Montrose. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and will always agree to a desert hike. :cactus:
