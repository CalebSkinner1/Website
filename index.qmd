Hello! I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. I moved to Houston after graduating with my Bachelor's degree from Baylor University in the Spring 2024.

I've always been a curious person, and, for me, statistics is an exciting instrument to uncover relationships and explore unanswered questions in this world. I chose a rigorous PhD program at Rice in order to be equipped to answer these questions. My current research focuses on Bayesian variable/model selection with applications in finance and genomics.

If I'm not modeling or dreaming of statistics, I like to cook with my wife, Sarah, or play a board game with some friends. I love playing and watching tennis (see [this website](https://calebskinner1.github.io/Tennis-GOAT/) for professional tennis analysis), and on Sunday morning, you'll find me at my church, Sojourn Montrose. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and I will always agree to a good desert hike.

For more information, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1), [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/calebskinner1), and [CV](Skinner%20Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf).
