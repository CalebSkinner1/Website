Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. I moved to Houston after graduating with my Bachelor's degree from Baylor University in the Spring 2024.

I've always been a curious person, and, for me, statistics is an exciting instrument to uncover relationships and explore unanswered questions in this world. I chose a rigorous PhD program at Rice in order to be equipped to answer these questions. I am interested in a variety of statistical fields including Time Series Analysis, Bayesian Statistics, Casual Inference, and Survival Analysis.

If I'm not modelling or dreaming of statistics, I like to cook with my wife, Sarah, or play a board game with some friends. I love playing and watching tennis, and on Sunday morning, you'll find me at my church, Sojourn Montrose. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and I will always agree to a good desert hike.
