I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. I moved to Houston after graduating with my Bachelor's degree from Baylor University in the Spring 2024.\n\nI've always been a curious person, and, for me, statistics is an exciting instrument to uncover relationships and explore unanswered questions in this world. I chose a rigorous PhD program at Rice in order to be equipped to answer these questions. I am interested in a variety of statistical fields including Time Series Analysis, Bayesian Statistics, Casual Inference, and Survival Analysis.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nIf I'm not modelling or dreaming of statistics, I like to cook with my wife, Sarah, or play a board game with some friends. I love playing and watching tennis, and on Sunday morning, you'll find me at my church, Sojourn Montrose. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and I will always agree to a good desert hike.\n\nFor more information, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/CalebSkinner1), [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/calebskinner1), and [CV](Skinner Curriculum Vitae.pdf).\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me at calebskinner01@gmail.com!\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"sandstone","title":"Caleb A.
