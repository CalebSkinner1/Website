    "text": "Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. I moved to Houston after graduating with my Bachelor’s degree from Baylor University in the Spring 2024.\nI’ve always been a curious person, and, for me, statistics is an exciting instrument to uncover relationships and explore unanswered questions in this world. I chose a rigorous PhD program at Rice in order to be equipped to answer these questions. I am interested in a variety of statistical fields including Time Series Analysis, Bayesian Statistics, Casual Inference, and Survival Analysis.\n\n\nIf I’m not modeling or dreaming of statistics, I like to cook with my wife, Sarah, or play a board game with some friends. I love playing and watching tennis (see this website for professional tennis analysis), and on Sunday morning, you’ll find me at my church, Sojourn Montrose. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and I will always agree to a good desert hike.\nFor more information, check out my GitHub, LinkedIn, and CV.\nPlease feel free to reach out to me at calebskinner01@gmail.com!"

    "text": "I am interested in a wide variety of statistical topics, but recently I have taken a particular liking to the Bayesian paradigm. Here are a brief list of some projects I have worked on recently. For more projects, please see my GitHub.\nSleeper Bayesian** (2024)** - With fellow PhD student, Daniel Illera, we model NBA player fantasy performance with a Bayesian normal hierarchical model. We then apply Game Theory principals to develop decision boundaries for fantasy users to optimize their performance.\nEnsemble Forecasting - In progress - Working with Dr. Meng Li, this project applies two novel ensemble forecasting methods, partially-egalitarian lasso (Diebold & Shin, 2019) and double-spiked dirichlet priors (Lin & Li, 2022), to expert forecasts of the quarterly unemployment rate and quarterly treasury bill rate. Both methods aim to shrink the forecaster pool and optimize the weight of the forecasters. Initial results show that the double-spiked dirichlet priors method provides preferable results.\nSkinner, C.; Sturdivant, R. (2024), “Is Momentum Real: On the Existence and Influences of Psychological Momentum in Tennis”\n\nUndergraduate Thesis measuring and analyzing psychological momentum under the direction of Dr. Rodney Sturdivant. You can find the final document here.\n\nSCORE Network Material Developer (Summer 2023)\n\nResearched and compiled formulas, explanations, and examples fit for teaching cluster analysis, inter-rater reliability, and logistic regression. Developed three 20-50-page interactive lesson plans using extensive data from three sports.\n\nSports Analytics Club – Vice President (2021-2023)\n\nCollaborated with Statistics PhD student Ryan Hebdon to develop a website (with R’s ShinyApp) filled with numerous interactive visualizations and tables utilized by Baylor baseball’s staff.\n\nGlobal Health Survey (2021-2022)\n\nProduced ~50 pages of visualizations and statistical analysis for a research paper assessing the opinions of Global Health among undergraduate students.\n\nFootball Analytics Blitz (2022)\n\nAnalyzed NFL data from 2021 to create a comprehensive game-strategy in Syracuse University’s case competition. Produced visualizations justifying decisions and presented conclusions to a panel of judges."
